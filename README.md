# Systems Programming Assignment 1
Assignment number 1 in the Systems Programming course in  Ben Gurion University of the Negev.
This is a 2nd year course in our Software Engineering degree.
The purpose of the assignment was to practice memory management (and a little bit of OOP) in C++.

# Compilation
When inside the directory run the command 'make' in the terminal.
The progmram compiles and runs on Linux. 

# Running and testing
There are 3 running files supplied in the tests folder, named 01.json, 02.json, 03.json.
Running them will produce an out file that is identical to the xx_sol.json file.
To run you can use the command './bin/cRace ./tests/02.json' after compiling.

# Visualisation
If you have python and Matplotlib installed you can visualise the simulation by running the command 
'python3 visualization.py tests/01.json'
